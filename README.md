## Description 

This simple website showcases Michael Hanson's CSS abilities through solutions to cssbattle.dev design challenges. 

Each page, as linked through the homepage, displays a solution built purely using CSS. 

Each solution is kept as 'short as possible' for score on cssbattle.dev, which is why class and id names are kept short and arbitrary. Code snippets uploaded here reflect my solutions before minified for further optimization (in order to be referenced and read more effectively).
